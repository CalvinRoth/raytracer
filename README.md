# Raytracer
This project was just a side project to be a more sophisticated ray tracer than the one built in my computer graphics course at the U of M. 
I implemented several interesting features including:
 + Parellization
 + The AABB data structure for faster collision detection
 + Better infastructure for adding objcts

This project is basically infinitely extensible but I have limited interest in it as of writing I have limited interest.
Top priorities would be
+ Convert output ppm file to png/jpg automatically, ppm is easy to write but inefficient
+ GPU parallelization might be neat
+ Potentially good project to use as a learn example learning a new langauge.
